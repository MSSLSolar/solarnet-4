# Installation of SolarSoftware (ssw)

Most of the software that will be used in the hands-on session will be using the
[solarsoft](http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/) library and [IDL](http://www.exelisvis.com/IntelliEarthSolutions/GeospatialProducts/IDL.aspx). Please, make sure you have them installed properly in 
your laptop. In case you don't have an IDL license, we will provide a network license
for the duration of the summer school and workshop.

To install solarsoft you should get an installation script from [this form](http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/ssw_install.html). Make sure
to select the following packages:

-   SDO/AIA and HMI
-   Hinode/EIS
-   Orbital Observatories/IRIS
-   Virtual Observatories/VSO

Once you download the form follow the "what do I do next?" link in the result page.

If you are using Linux or Mac OS you then could create a *ssw* file to run IDL
with solarsoft from the bash terminal. Follow the instructions in [this blogpost](http://dpshelio.github.io/blog/2015/10/08/GetBash.html)
and change the variables defined and the `SSW_INSTR` accordingly (using the list
of instruments above).

If you are a OS X user you will need to install [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org/).

# Installation of other software

## Paraview

Paraview is is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualisation
application. This will be used to visualise 3D magnetic field extrapolations.
Follow the [download instructions](http://www.paraview.org/download/) to install it in your machine. If you are
using Linux you can also get it by using the package-manager of your distribution
(e.g., dnf, apt-get, ...).

# During the workshop

## IDL Licenses.

The instructions on how to access the IDL license will be provided in the
workshop.

## Data

We are going to work with a lot of data, you should downloaded it before the
workshop starts to avoid delays due to the network. The data needed is available
in [the material section](/material/).
